# System Folder

## Main Script
The main script is called RCDB_Web_Scraper_&_logistic_regression.py

## Explanation
The subsystems have no interdependencies or trade-offs
and as such the system level optimisation consists of
minimising the functions of each subsystem. For this 
reason it was unnecessary to write code for the system 
level optimisation. Instead a Python script was was used to scrape an internet database of rollercoasters 
and conduct an explanatory analysis on the data for research
purposes. It also runs a logistic regression model to determine 
which physical properties of the roller-coaster result in it
being successful or defunct, with the ability to take user 
input values and apply them to the logistic regression model.
The code conducts analysis on how accurate the logistic
regression model is and returns various relevant plots saved
in the folder. 

## Execution Time

The time the code takes to execute depends on
wether a new database is being built, or if more data points are
being appended to an existing database and how many data points
are being retrieved/added. It is recommended to run the code
with the pre-built dataset rather than building a new one, this will take around 300ms.
This is further explained in the terminal when the code is run.

## Dependencies
The python dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. The dependencies can be installed by 
opening a shell in the system folder and executing pip install requirements.txt
